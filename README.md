# getread
This is a professional readMe generator. This will expand and be a very helpful tool in the future. Right now it only has the bare minumum for grading as I didn't want to add anything and have points removed, 
or risk the functionality. 

To use this app you enter node.js into the integrated terminal and answer the prompts. Info generated from the promps is used to generate the readMe.
